# XGBoost Models and Datasets for Demand-Intensity model predictions

Repository contains Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models trained to predict demand-intensity models of Reinforced Concrete buildings with masonry infills. The training was based on results of Multiple Stripe Analysis (MSA) of the buildings.
